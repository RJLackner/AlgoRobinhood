## Running the tests

Simply <em>git clone</em> this codebase and execute the below command. After sucessfully login in, a log file will be generated under <em>/log</em>, with detailed information like recommendations made from a tensorflow model predction, as well as buy/sell operations being executed if any.<br>

 <em>python <strong>AutoTrade.py</strong></em>

```
