# AlgoRobinhood

Algorithmic Trading System with Machine Learning

- An <strong>Algorithmic Trading System</strong> connecting to Robinhood to execute various algo trading strategies
- Stocks <strong>Recommendation System</strong> based on <strong>Machine Learning</strong> Models


## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to run an algo trading system on your local machine

### Prerequisites

You need a [robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) account with a two factor code setup using your phone number. At the point of executing AlgoRobinhood, you will put the account id, password and the two-factor codes in terminal to login

```
$ python AutoTrade.py

Enter your account id: abc@somemail.com
Do you want to run recommendation code (y/n): y
What recommendation model you want to use (LSTM/RF): LSTM
Enter your password: *****
Please Enter SMS Code: ******

## Running the AlgoRobinhood

Simply <em>git clone</em> this codebase and execute the below command. After successfully login in, a log file will be generated under <em>/log</em>, with detailed information like recommendations made from a tensorflow model predction, as well as buy/sell operations being executed if any<br>

 <em><strong>python AutoTrade.py</strong></em>

```
